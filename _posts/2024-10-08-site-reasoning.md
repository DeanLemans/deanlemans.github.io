# Preface
technically this was would be my third ([First](https://github.com/DeanLemans/my-first-web-page), [Second](https://github.com/DeanLemans/burgerschap-FAKE-NEWS)) *site*, but this is my first **proper** site.
 

## Why does this site exist?
```
> We got an assigment to make our own portofolio site.
> because I am in the group game development group
(our class is split in game and web)
> School decided to give us some frameworks
> The provided frameworks were: wordpress, wix and webflow(no coding involved)
> So I decided to look for different frameworks
```
## Personal Requirements
1. I have no interest in html, css and js.
2. I like to write.
3. accesibility.
- Based on these requirements, I found these 2 frameworks

> (note: I chose jekyll over hugo for greater custimisability.)
{: .prompt-info }

[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) and [mediagoblin](https://mediagoblin.org/)

### Mediagobin
- Pros
    - supports audio files, videos and 3D-models.
    - build in comment system.
- Cons
    - no inbuild GitHub pages support.

### Jekyll Chirpy Theme
- Pros
    - inbuild GitHub pages support.
    - static site.
    - build in comment system.
    - inbuild Table Of Content.
    - .md to html.
- Cons 
    - building on locally on windows, (works fine on linux though).


## TLDR;
```
----I chose Jekyll Chirpy for:----
> inbuild GitHub pages. 
> accesibility.
> detailed instuctions.
> simple .md files to html.
> replacement for obsidian publish.
```

## Reflection/Feedback;
- I found out that when copying (relative)path  * / becomes \ * and that doesnt work.
- I wish I could add more stuff to my portofolio.
- Should have focused on quality more instead of quantity.
- make it simpler(make post tabs, or just remove some tabs).
