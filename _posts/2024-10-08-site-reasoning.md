I looked at the frameworks that were provided to use and didn't want to use js but i also wanted to code a bit myself

- (I chose jekyll over hugo for greater custimisability)

So I found these 2 frameworks where you at least have to code a bit yourself but do provide a template/theme:
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) and [mediagoblin](https://mediagoblin.org/)

### mediagobin
#### pros
- supports audio files, videos, and 3D-models
- build in comment system
#### cons
- no inbuild GitHub pages support
- have to learn how to host stuff myself.
### jekyll chirpy theme
#### pros
- inbuild GitHub pages support
- static site
- build in comment system
#### cons 

- difficulty building on locally on windows, (works fine on linux)


### I choose/will use jekyll chirpy theme because it has inbuild GitHub pages support. And has detailed instuctions how to use their template.
