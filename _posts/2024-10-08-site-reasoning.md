I looked at the frameworks that were provided to us and i did not like them. 
with wordpress/wix you (almost) cant code and
didn't want to use js
**but I wanted to code a bit myself and have control over my own code**

so based on these (self imposed) requirements;
I found these 2 frameworks
- (I chose jekyll over hugo for greater custimisability)


[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) and [mediagoblin](https://mediagoblin.org/)

### mediagobin
#### pros
- supports audio files, videos, and 3D-models
- build in comment system
#### cons
- no inbuild GitHub pages support
- have to learn how to host stuff myself.

### jekyll chirpy theme
#### pros
- inbuild GitHub pages support
- static site
- build in comment system
#### cons 
- difficulty building on locally on windows, (works fine on linux though)


*I chose use jekyll chirpy theme because it has inbuild GitHub pages support. 
And also has detailed instuctions how to use and modify their theme.*
