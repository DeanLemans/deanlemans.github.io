I looked at the frameworks that were provided to me for the assigment(there is almost no coding involved in wordpress and wix) and i did not like them. 
and since I have no interest in html, css and js.
**but I wanted to code a bit myself and have control over my own code**

so based on these requirements:
I found these 2(3) frameworks
>note: I chose jekyll over hugo for greater custimisability


[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) and [mediagoblin](https://mediagoblin.org/)

### mediagobin
#### pros
- supports audio files, videos, and 3D-models
- build in comment system
#### cons
- no inbuild GitHub pages support
- have to learn how to host stuff myself.

### jekyll chirpy theme
#### pros
- inbuild GitHub pages support
- static site
- build in comment system
#### cons 
- building on locally on windows, (works fine on linux though)


### TLDR;
- inbuild GitHub pages support. 
- accesibility
- detailed instuctions how to use and modify their theme.
- able to use obsidian to edit/keep track of my files.
- able to convert .MD files to post(html) that display automatically.
- able to open in obsidian.
- can act as an replacement for obsidian publish.

## Reflection;
- I found out that when copying (relative)path the / becomes \ and that doesnt work.
- I wish I could add more stuff to my portofolio.
- Should have focused on quality more instead of adding quantity.
- make it simpler(remove tag and catagories)
