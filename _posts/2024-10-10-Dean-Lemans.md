I like [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) and [Free](https://writefreesoftware.org/learn) [Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).
- In the case of FOSS software being worse then the proprietry alternative,(I.E; Discord > Matrix, Google Play > F-Droid) I will use the proprietry alternative.
- What software I use; GIMP, void linux/ opensuse tumbleweed, thorium browser, Godot, Zed.

[**This**](https://codeberg.org/deanlemans) is my codeberg page
-I'm planning to transfer all of my repositories from github to codeberg when I'm done with school, but for now my school wants me to use github(which is understandable, as its the most popular code hosting site).
